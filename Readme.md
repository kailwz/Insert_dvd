<h1>Insert dvd app</h1>
I saw this in the office so i want to try to program this, theres not much to it, i just wanted to do it because i thik this is funny,
and i also like to see how the think works from behind the screen.

<h2>Project Over View</h2>
Its a square that bounces around and chages color between red, blue and green,
it also makes a noise when he touches the side of the window, and you can background music just adding a "audio.mp3"
file in the music path.
Somehow i managed to do the most clean C code that i ever wrote, so i think thats good.
